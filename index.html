    <h2>Some basic facts about myself</h2>

   <ul>
    <li>I grew up in the rural midwest, in the town of Scottsbluff Nebraska.</li>
    <li>Before starting this program(Thinkful) I had zero experience with coding or any sort of software engineering.</li>
    <li>I am an avid video-gamer, as well as tabletop game enthusiast.</li>
    <li>I have an Associates Degree in psychology</li>
    <li>I am attempting to teach myself(albeit very slowly) how to play guitar.</li>
   </ul>

      There is much more that could be listed, but it isn't prudent to put too much of yourself online.
      Regardless my Github profile is <a href="https://www.github.com/AJVDV/">here</a>.

   I'm not sure what sort of information, be it an actual article, weather reports, or perhaps some sort of local news, to include here yet. For now this text will simply have to act as a placeholder.

    <p>Odd that I chose not to put my actual location in the main portion of this section, but I am based out of Kent WA.</p>
